**Hello World!**  
I'm currently a third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I'm also currently in an internship at **FarmLink Marketing Solutions**, working as a software developer.  

I specialize in fullstack web development. I love to learn new frameworks and languages, and I'm always looking to improve my skills. I'm also a big fan of the open-source community, and I'm always looking to learn new things.  
  
I write about my journey as a developer and many other things.
